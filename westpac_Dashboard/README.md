## Overview
This repository contains two Power BI dashboards exported as PDF from the Westpac sample report you provided:
1. **Loan Summary Dashboard** - summary of loans, risk categories, defaults, KPIs.
2. **Transaction Analysis Dashboard** - transaction counts, amounts, filters by type/region/status.

## Files Included
- `Westpac_Dashboards_Combined.pdf` — original combined PDF (keeps the exact pages you shared).
- `Loan_Summary_Dashboard.pdf` — page 1 (Loan Summary).
- `Transaction_Insights_Dashboard.pdf` — page 2 (Transaction Analysis).
- `README.md` — this file.

## Suggested Screenshots to Add (manually)
For better preview on GitHub, add 2–3 PNG screenshots for each dashboard under a `screenshots/` folder:
- `screenshots/loan_overview.png`
- `screenshots/loan_kpis.png`
- `screenshots/txn_overview.png`
- `screenshots/txn_kpis.png`

How to take screenshots:
- Open the PDF (double-click `Loan_Summary_Dashboard.pdf`) and zoom so the dashboard fills the screen.
- On Windows: use Snipping Tool / Snip & Sketch → New → select area → Save as `loan_overview.png`.
- On Mac: press `Cmd+Shift+4` → select area → file saved to Desktop → move to `screenshots/` folder.

## How to upload to GitHub (easy web steps)
1. Create a new public repository on GitHub named `westpac-bank-loan-analysis`. Tick "Add a README".
2. Open the repo → click **Add file → Upload files**.
3. Upload the PDFs (`Loan_Summary_Dashboard.pdf`, `Transaction_Insights_Dashboard.pdf`), and the `screenshots/` PNGs (if you added them).
4. Commit with message: `Add PDFs and screenshots`.
5. Edit `README.md` in the GitHub web editor (you can replace with this README content if needed) and commit changes.
6. Pin the repo to your profile (Your profile → Customize your pins → select `westpac-bank-loan-analysis`).

## If you have the original .pbix (Power BI) file
- If pbix <= 100MB: you can upload directly to the repo (Add file → Upload files).
- If pbix > 100MB: upload to Google Drive/OneDrive and add the share link in the README under a "Download PBIX" section.
